He's lonely
Sitting by the river
Awakened by the horses
In circles
Running in the circus
His red nose
Looking damaged in the mirror
Cause no one has replace it
He's dressed now
Ready to make fun now
He loves Sundays
In every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
He's lonely
Sitting by the river
Still broken,
Undressed now,
Ready for a new town
They love his show
Their favorite part
That gives them a laugh
They love his show
Their favorite part
Relaxes their hearts
